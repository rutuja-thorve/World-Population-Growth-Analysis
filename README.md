# üåç World Population Analysis Project

This project focuses on analyzing global population trends from 1970 to 2022 using Machine Learning, Python, and Excel. The dataset includes various demographic parameters such as country size, population density, growth rate, ranking, and world population percentage. The goal was to explore historical data, identify key factors influencing population changes, and predict future population growth.

## üîç Project Overview:
- **Languages/Tools:** Python, SQL, Excel
- **Libraries Used:** Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly
- **Techniques:** Data Cleaning, EDA, Feature Engineering, Model Building, Model Evaluation, Data Visualization

## üìä Key Insights:
- India‚Äôs population surged from 557 million in 1970 to around 1.4 billion by 2020.
- Ukraine was identified as the slowest-growing country with a growth rate of 0.9120%.
- Greenland ranks highest for available land area per capita.
- Visualizations reveal population trends for the top 10 most populated countries.

## üöÄ Project Workflow:
1. Data Cleaning & Processing
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Feature Engineering & Machine Learning Model Building
4. Model Evaluation & Future Population Predictions
5. Data Visualization & Report Generation

This project demonstrates the power of Machine Learning in understanding and predicting global population trends
